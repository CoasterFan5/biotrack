            If your browser reports this page as unsafe, it is mistaken. While
            the warning is accurate (this page fakes an HTTPS certificate,
            which is unsafe, as it is not verified by a certificate authority),
            the page itself won't harm your computer, and it still remains
            encrypted from bad actors.
