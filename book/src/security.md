# Security

biotrack employs a variety of different security tactics, but here are some of the
decisions that were made in the design of the system.

## Officers

Officers are users that are allowed to non-destructively interact with the biotrack dashboard.
They can manage relatively any aspect of the database, as long as it doesn't
_delete_ any information, as the project is aimed in data analysis - it would
be a shame to lose any data.

Officers have two tiers:

- Regular, where they can add and manage players, and manage queuing and sessions for games.
- Admins, who can manage and create other officers, and create and archive games.

Officers are able to log in through the dashboard, and
all passwords are hashed and salted using [pbkdf2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2).

## Game Tokens

Game tokens are used to authenticate a game to the biotrack server. They are
generated by the server and are used to authenticate all [API](./api.md) requests.
